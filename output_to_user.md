I have added more detailed logging to the main entry point of the application. Please perform the following steps *exactly* as described:

1.  **Log out** of the application completely to ensure a clean state.
2.  **Log back in** as you normally would.
3.  After logging in, you should be on your dashboard. **Copy the URL from your browser's address bar** and send it to me.
4.  Next, **click on a notification** that should take you to a specific page.
5.  You will be redirected to the login page. **Copy the URL from the address bar of the login page** and send it to me.

This process will create a detailed log that should allow me to see exactly what is happening to the session.
